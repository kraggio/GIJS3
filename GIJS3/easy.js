// EASY: A local gym wants to implement an "exercise of the day" program where there is a 
//free class that day that promotes a certain exercise. The gym needs some backend logic that will 
//update its system to reflect which exercise will be promoted that day. Write a function that will take as 
//an input the name of an exercise and console log a message like Today's exercise: running
// Note: you should only write one function that can dynamically print the value of the exercise for that day,
//and it must be a closure

const exercise = (function() {
    let currentExercise;
    return function(exercise) {
        currentExercise = exercise;
        console.log(`Todays exercise: ${currentExercise}`);
    }
})();

// Output: Today's exercise: Running
console.log(exercise("Running")); 

//  // Output: Today's exercise: Swimming
console.log(exercise("Swimming"));

// Output: Today's exercise: Dancing
console.log(exercise("Dancing")); 

// Output: Today's exercise: Fencing
console.log(exercise("Fencing"));
